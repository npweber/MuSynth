# v1_1

Additions:
- Added a few extra options for selecting a Duration that are variants from the old existing options. For example, `FAST --> FAST & FAST_PLUS`, in which `FAST_PLUS` will provide more variance in note duration length. Having more short, fast note lengths that are distributed into the note sequence pattern, more variance can be added into a Fast note sequence. When this is applied to every other Duration existing, note sequences are more effectively generated.
- Added more sizes for the amount of notes in a loop to choose from.
- Created the ability to repeat playback of a loop.
- Created the ability to generate another loop from the existing parameters.

Changes:
- Packages now conform to new packaging system, `tech.npwd`.
