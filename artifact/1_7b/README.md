# v1_7b

*Establishes FULLY FUNCTIONAL Loop Patterns*

Additions:
- Added "Durations.java" Enum: Defines the different durations of notes by subjective qualities. Each quality is an understandable word that describes the duration amount. For example, `FAST --> 175ms` . By defining the input for the program in qualities, deciding the tempo becomes achievable.
- "Sizes.java" Enum: Defines the different amounts of notes to play in a loop. For example, `SMALL --> 3 Notes`. For the same reasons, deciding the size of the loop becomes achievable.

Fixes:
- Fixed Generator.java producing notes that overlap each other
