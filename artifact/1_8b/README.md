# v1_8b

*FULLY FUNCTIONING Beta Build*

Additions:
- Added "Ordering.java" Enum: Controls ordering of notes in sequence. Musically, ordering would be described as Low to High notes or High to Low notes. Ordering.java keeps track of that by using values `ASCENDING` and `DESCENDING`. Either value can be selected in the program arguments, for different outcomes in the note sequence.

Changes:
- Note sequences now have variance after they are constructed, **completing the task of making an authentic note sequence without almost any human intervention**.
